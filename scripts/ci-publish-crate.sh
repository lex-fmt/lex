#
# `cargo publish` (1.66+) already waits for the crate to be available in the
# sparse index before returning, so no extra polling is needed here. The
# pre-check against crates.io's JSON API is only to skip the whole compile
# step when this version is already published (e.g. re-running a failed job).

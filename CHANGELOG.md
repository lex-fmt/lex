# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `lexd` now accepts piped input on stdin for `inspect`, `convert`, and `format` when the file path is omitted. Examples:
  - `cat foo.lex | lexd inspect ast-tag`
  - `cat foo.lex | lexd --from lex --to markdown`
  - `cat foo.lex | lexd format`

  `convert` requires `--from` when reading from stdin (there is no filename to auto-detect the source format from).

## 0.8.0

### Breaking

- Rename CLI binary and package: `lex-cli` -> `lexd` (binary: `lex` -> `lexd`)
- Rename LSP binary and package: `lex-lsp` -> `lexd-lsp` (binary: `lex-lsp` -> `lexd-lsp`)
- Installation is now `cargo install lexd` and `cargo install lexd-lsp`
- Release artifacts renamed: `lexd-{target}.tar.gz`, `lexd-lsp-{target}.tar.gz`
- `lexd` is now published to crates.io (previously `lex-cli` was not published)

The rename avoids conflicts with the Unix `lex` lexical analyzer generator, which shadows the binary on many systems. Internal library crates (`lex-core`, `lex-babel`, `lex-config`, `lex-analysis`) are unchanged.
